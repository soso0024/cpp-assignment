# Gorillas Game Project

## Description
This project implements a game named "Gorillas" in C++. It features a class `GorillaAI` that uses PID control for AI behavior within the game. The game likely involves strategic elements controlled by AI, making use of proportional, integral, and derivative controls to influence gameplay.

## Installation
To install and run the Gorillas game:
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the `gorillas` directory.
4. Compile the code. For example, using g++: `g++ -o gorillas gorillas.cpp`
5. Run the compiled executable: `./gorillas`

## Usage
After running the game, follow the on-screen instructions to play. The game likely involves interaction with the Gorilla AI, where players can experience the AI's behavior influenced by PID control.
